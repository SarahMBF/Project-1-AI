 **Global AI Impact Analysis in 10 Countries vs salaries AI engineer**

## **Introduction**
welcome to my Project. This project explores the global impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by analyzing job salary data across 10 countries. The goal is to  **Analysing the correlation between Higher AI engineer salaries and AI maturity** in each country. Data was collected using API queries (Jsearch) from websites providing job listings, focusing on AI job salaries and an existing datasetes.



## **Data Description**

- **Sources**: Job Salaeries AI and Marketing API (Jsearch)from RapidAPI and existing datasets from Kaggle Datasets

- **Data Collected**:
  - AI-related job max, min and medien salaries in 10 different countries with updated date
  - cleaned datasetes revneu AI for different Industry between  2020-2025 
  -

- **Main Challenges**:
Find a suitable API and understand how it works
    
Clarify API request limits
Learn how to request relevant data
Handle data inconsistencies across countries (e.g. currencies, formats)
Standardize salary formats (hourly, monthly, yearly)
Understand the existing and cleaned datasets

- **Strengths**:
  - cleaning and formating the datasets
  - understand the data

- **Weaknesses**:
Align year ranges between existing data and API data
Merge dataframes correctly using matching columns
Focus on general AI salary data, not industry-specific figures

**Hypothesis**
Countries with higher median salaries for AI engineers reflect greater AI maturity, as indicated by higher consumer trust in AI and increased revenue growth due to AI adoption. 

**Conclusion**:  
"Higher AI salaries ≠  Greater AI maturity"
AI maturity depends on regulatory support and local use cases, not just salaries.


## **Methodology**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Used Jsearch API to gather AI  job salary data for 10 countries and Datasetes from Kaggle as csv file about Global Impact of AI (2020–2025)
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardized salary formats (yearly/monthly/hourly -> annual salary) and also for the currency
   - Filtered out incomplete or irrelevant listings and dictioneries 
   - drop not related columns
   
   - Ensured job titles matched the intended categories (AI)
   -average of of consumer trust in AI by the different Industries
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculated average renenue in each country.

   - Visualized salary comparisons with bar charts and scatter plots.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Compared salary trends to known to Consumer trust in AI indexes to see if high salaries aligned with AI Maturity and Revenue.
   - Conducted simple correlation analysis
